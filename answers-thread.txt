Cases are that when there are 2 threads both putting keys in the bucket, the following situation could cause the missing:
Thread1:
in function insert:
	e->key = key;
  	e->value = value;
  	e->next = n;
NOW Time for Thread1 is up.Time for Thread2.
Coincidentally, Thread2 is also going to execute the same line, i.e.
	*p=e;
THEN Time is up again. Thread1 is under control again. Thread1 continues its code, just the same as Thread2 has just executed:
	*p=e;

So this is the problem.*p has been assigned to different values, which caused the first value has not been saved before being covered by the second value.
The first key is lost.

Notice that, the missing of keys is not the only problem. There might be the same key with same value in a bucket also due to the shared access to a same bucket.
